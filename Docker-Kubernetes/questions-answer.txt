1)	Prepare a docker-compose for a nginx server.
Requirements:
•	nginx logs need to survive between nginx container restarts
•	docker should use network bridge subnet 172.20.8.0/24

Answer: docker-compose file has been created, need to run below command to up the custome network.
        docker-compose up -d
        check the network: docker network inspect nginx_docker_custom_bridge
        restart the nginx container & verify the logs: docker-compose restart nginx
                                                       docker-compose exec nginx ls /var/log/nginx


2)	Which Kubernetes command you will use to identify the reason for a pod restart in the project "internal" under namespace "production".

Answer: list pods in production namespace
        kubectl get pods -n production

        describe pod
        kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n production

3. Application pod has the following resource quota:
•	Memory request & limit: 1000 & 1500
•	CPU request & limit: 1000 & 2000
•	Xmx of 1000M
Java-app keep restarting at random.  From Kubernetes configuration perspective, what are the possible reasons for the pod restarts?

Answer: 1. it's possible that the container is experiencing CPU spikes that exceed its allocation.
        2. it's possible that the container is experiencing memory spikes that exceed its allocation.
        3. If the pod is consistently using more CPU than its request (1000m), it might be throttled.
