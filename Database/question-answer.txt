1)	Cassandra
Query to db cluster returns different result each time.  Users reported query result has data records that they deleted days ago.  
Explain what the likely reason for the behavior and how to avoid it.
Ans: Pass

2)	Mongo
Performance is bad as the hardware of replicaset_1 is not capable to handle the database sanfrancisco.  We added a new replicaset_2.  
Please provide all steps required to shard the collection sanfrancisco.company_name based on _id.

Ans: 
1. Connect to MongoDB Shell
2. Enable Sharding on the Database:
    use admin
    sh.enableSharding("sanfrancisco")
3. Add Shards to the Cluster:
    sh.addShard("replicaset_1/<replicaset_1_member1>")
    sh.addShard("replicaset_2/<replicaset_2_member1>")
4. Enable Sharding on the Collection
    use sanfrancisco
    sh.shardCollection("sanfrancisco.company_name", { "_id": 1 })
5. Verify the Sharding Status
    sh.status()
